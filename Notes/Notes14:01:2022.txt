Try to reference using electrodes within ROI.

Non-parametric granger need to do from 0-Nyquist frequency. Demeaning,Tapering,remove artifact,Demeaning again.

See the granger spectral of each patient (even each electrode pair)

Subtract the 50hz line noise  using data fitting in 20ms time window(detect peak frequency and back to time domain to do subtraction)


Use fixed time window try to remove the zigzag in power spectral


Cut in to small segments, then tapering(Hannin taper), then spectral, cohence


Compare with fixation baseline before each movie,log transform
